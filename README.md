# python-revival-of-code-22

Revival of code event ran by the python [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/python). This repository contains my solutions to the problems in the event, which I'll make changes to after I look at other solutions. Hopefully my code will end up more pythonic as a result :)

> Revival of Code is a Python Discord hosted event where we revisit old Advent of Code puzzles from a previous year. The puzzles start off easy and gradually get more difficult while revealing a fun little story. Questions will be posted every other day, and you'll be able to discuss your solutions in the thread attached to the bot message.
